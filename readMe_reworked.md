This code is a chatbot that helps users monitor their energy usage. It imports necessary libraries, preprocesses data on energy usage, fits a linear regression model to predict usage, and provides various energy-saving tips based on usage levels. The chatbot also has a simple natural language processing (NLP) component using the Spacy library to handle different user inputs. It can generate different visualizations like line charts, heatmaps, bar charts, and pie charts to represent energy usage data.
