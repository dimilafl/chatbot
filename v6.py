# description

    #The machine learning aspect of this code involves using historical energy usage data to train a linear regression model, which can then be used to predict the user's energy usage for the current day.
    # The code loads the historical energy usage data from a CSV file and uses the scikit-learn library to fit a linear regression model to the data. The input to the model is the day of the week (represented as an integer between 0 and 6), and the output is the energy usage for that day.
    # Once the model is trained, the chatbot can use it to provide personalized responses based on the user's energy usage. For example, the usage response uses the model to predict the user's energy usage for the current day, based on the day of the week. The history response provides a summary of the user's energy usage for the past week, based on the historical data that was used to train the model.
    # Overall, the machine learning aspect of this code allows the chatbot to provide more personalized and accurate responses based on the user's energy usage patterns, which can help the user better understand their energy usage and identify areas where they can save energy and reduce costs.










# In this updated code, I added three lists of energy-saving tips based on energy usage levels: `low_usage_tips`, `medium_usage_tips`, and `high_usage_tips`. These lists contain specific tips that are more relevant to users with different levels of energy usage.
# I also modified the `responses` dictionary to set the `tip` response to `None`, since we'll set it later based on the user's energy usage.
# Finally, I added some code to the `main` function that sets the `tip` response based on the user's energy usage. The code uses the linear regression model to predict the user's energy usage for the current day, and then selects a tip list based on the energy usage level. A random tip is then selected from the corresponding list and set as the `tip` response in the `responses` dictionary.
# With these changes, the chatbot should provide more personalized energy-saving tips based on the user's energy usage levels.
